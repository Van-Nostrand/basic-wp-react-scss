# Basic webpack / react / scss app template

I made this on my quest to figure out what `create-react-app` actually does. So, this is my lighter-weight alternative to create-react-app!

From the command line inside the root folder, run `npm install`. The resulting folder should be ~71MB, as opposed to create-react-app's ~150MB.  

`npm start` will start the dev-server.
`npm run build` will create the bundle inside a folder called `dist/`.
